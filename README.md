# Spring Boot + Gradle + React + Webpack

This is a sample application to get started on using React with Spring Boot.

## Technologies
1. Spring Boot - https://start.spring.io
2. Gradle - https://gradle.org
3. ReactJS - https://reactjs.org
4. Webpack - https://webpack.js.org

### SpringBoot
Here, spring boot is acting as our backend which is serving the initial page and provides API's for other interactions.

### Gradle
Build tool for our app

### REACT JS
A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes.

### Webpack
At its core, webpack is a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles. It helps compile your javascript files (in this example react js files) into a bundle.js making sure most browsers are able to understand while still allowing engineers to code in latest ES syntax.
